## Description

This is a simple Flutter app using [giphy api](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide "Giphy API website"). You can search for different gifs, and if there is no input in the search bar, it shows trending gifs. The app also has the functionality to load more gifs as you scroll down.

## Quick start

To try the app for yourself, you will have to get a [giphy api key](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true "Giphy API website"). It's completely free.

## What to add in the near future

1. Ability to save favourite gifs.
2. Option to switch from listView to gridView.
